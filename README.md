# [Annie Generator]([https://roomGPT.io](https://annie-generator.vercel.app/)) - Generate Annie With AI

It uses an ML model called stable diffusion that was trained using Dreambooth on images of Annie so it can generate variations of my girlfriend Annie from a prompt. This application gives you the ability to enter any prompt, which will be sent to the trained model for prediction using a Next.js API route pointing to Replicate to return your generated Annie. The ML Model is hosted on [Replicate](https://replicate.com) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for image storage and retrieval for the gallery.
